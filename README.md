Build FizzBuzz. It's a children's game where you count from 1 to 20. Easy, right?

Here's the catch: instead of saying numbers divisible by 3, say "Fizz". And instead of saying numbers divisible by 5, say "Buzz". For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, say "FizzBuzz". "1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz"...and so forth.
